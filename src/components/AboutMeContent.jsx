              Raised and brought up in Delhi, I did my schooling in Delhi and
              moved to Vellore to pursue electrical engineering at VIT Vellore.
              I’m a frontend developer and product designer who works with
              next.js, react.js, tailwind css, Figma, and blah blah.

              The real me is someone who adapts to things in a heartbeat,
              whether life or career. Don’t worry I don't go around making
              callous decisions to f up my life. I’m quite sorted actually. I go
              out a lot to meet my friends. Sometimes that leads to partying
              together(it’s rare but counts).

              In my four years of college, I was constantly traveling between
              Bangalore and Delhi since the pandemic was so erratic but that’s
              an experience not a lot get to live very often.

              Like any college-going student, I went for my boys' trip to
              Vietnam where I met such amiable people and annoyed the hell out
              of my parents explaining how different the people there and here
              are. I don’t think they took it very well though. I mean I was
              kinda ruining their whole asian parent vibe there haha. Although
              the food there, yeah not for me. Hey, I’m all about trying out new
              things but not when it comes to food- I stick to McD whenever and
              wherever needed.

              I like to read. I’ve tried all the genres out there.  but still,
              I’m a huge fan of non-fiction, especially books that teach how to
              be in the top 1%. For instance, “rich dad, poor dad”, “the brief
              history of Time”, and”21 Lessons for the 21st Century” are some of
              the reads that helped me move ahead.

              In the busy schedule that I willingly signed up for, I sneak out
              of home sometimes and go on long drives just to clear my head. The
              fresh breath of air and the subtle breeze ignites me to work
              harder and be better. So if you’re ever not feeling up to it, just
              think about what the real me told you to do- take care of the
              small things and the more significant things shall fall into
              place. just stop yourself, clear your head, and breathe. One day,
              you’ll be sitting on the bed with your legs crisscrossed pondering
              how to introduce yourself and document all your achievements and
              the crazy highlights of your life just like I am right now.
